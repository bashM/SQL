In this assingment we were assinged to create an applecation that take infromation from the data 
base.  there are 5 main tables in the databse in which we get our infromation from. 
in my program i have 5 main functions. 
1: where the applecation return back the information of fromarea, fromphone , toarea, tophone 
all you need to do is entering the right formats to get the result back 
2: in this fuction users can deleted unwanted information, so in here i used the update qurey 
In which take the valuse that usres entered such as cid of the unwanted information to be deleted 
3: in here users can look at the billing address, address, and name of phone calls. also, users 
can see the durations of evey phone calls that were done! 
4: the search and geting the summry as a reports.  in here users can look at the billing address
, sum of how many time they made phone calls. also, users can enter the date that is needed to 
generate the whole information as given in the SQL qurey. 
5: in here the shutdown sestem.  where uses can just press Q to exit the program and exit the 
applecation. 
 
 I developed this program in only one .cpp file.  i was hoping to add a .h or a header file
 however, this program is so simple this no need for a header file. 

 At the end i hope this program met all the requrments, and nothing is missing.
